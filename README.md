# google2fa-without-laravel
A forked Google2FA PHP library without Laravel, allowing include and run directly.
This is a modified version from https://github.com/antonioribeiro/google2fa
Most of Google2FA PHP library on github using composer to install, it makes the project become heavy.
If you just need a plug and play library, this is the suitable solution.
Just place the PragmaRX folder at the same level with your php file.
In the case you want to place the library in subfolder, you must change the require_once paths in all files of Google2FA folder.

This modified library is tested with Google Authenticator at May 24 2021.
